# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

This project will allow me to practice using 3rd party APIs like bootstrap and jQuery.

## Usage
Visit the [Work Day Scheduler Webpage](https://wmr89.github.io/calendar_app/) to view the calendar.

The webpage will display past time blocks in gray, future time blocks in green, and the current time clock in red.

Click on the desired hour block and enter your calendar event. Click the save button on the right-hand side to store the calendar event data in local storage.
